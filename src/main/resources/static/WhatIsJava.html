<p class="western">Java is an exciting object oriented programming
language supporting the four main object oriented programming
principles, and compiled Java byte code executes within a Java
Virtual Machine.</p>
<p class="western">Abstraction is a way of refining a real world
object or an idea preserving only the essential details.  Java
supports this well with “class” and “interface”.  The “class”
is used to define abstraction with implementation details.  The
“interface” is used to define abstraction without implementation
details.  
</p>
<p class="western">Encapsulation refines abstraction by hiding the
details.  Java supports this well with access modifiers such as
“public”, “protected”, and “private”.</p>
<p class="western">Inheritance further refines encapsulation by
defining specialized abstraction from generalized abstraction.  This
creates an is-relationship between abstractions.  Java supports this
well with “abstract class” and “extends”, where “abstract
class” allows defining of generalized abstraction while “extends”
allows defining of specialized abstraction. 
</p>
<p class="western">Polymorphism is dependent on inheritance and
allows specialized abstraction to be treated as generalized
abstraction.  Java supports this well with method overriding.  The
method overriding allows specialized abstraction to override methods
in generalized abstraction in such a way that when the method in the
generalized abstraction is called, the method in the specialized
abstraction is executed instead.</p>
